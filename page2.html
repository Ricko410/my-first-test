        if you’re reading this article, you may be one of the 370 million-odd
        native English speakers,<br />
        or one of the billion people who speak it as a second language.
        <br />
        This indicates the remarkable success of English as the lingua franca of
        business, <br />
        travel and international relations. The relative ease with which English
        can be picked up <br />
        (especially compared with Chinese) and the pervasive soft power of U.S.
        culture means that English <br />
        will continue to dominate the world stage for the foreseeable future.
        <br />
        For some, English is still synonymous with opportunity and a better
        quality of life.

      <p class="s">
        Recent numbers put Arabic at around 362 million native speakers. <br />
        But this is another instance of numbers not telling the full tale:
        Arabic, like Chinese, <br />
        is so vastly different in its respective dialects as to be effectively a
        number of languages, <br />
        grouped as one for the sake of convenience. Modern Standard Arabic is a
        primarily written form, <br />closely related to the Classical Arabic of
        the Quran. However, the spoken forms of Arabic in, <br />
        say, Oman and Morocco are so different that a couple of philosophy
        professors from <br />these countries might be able to discuss the finer
        points of the ancient texts while still struggling to order lunch.

        ndia has 23 official languages, with Hindi/Urdu chief among them.
        Whether this is one language — Hindustani — <br />
        or two dialects is still fiercely debated. Spoken mainly in northern
        India and parts of Pakistan,
        <br />
        Hindi uses devnagri script, while Urdu uses Persian notation. If you
        ever travel in the Indian subcontinent, <br />
        a little Hindi will get you a long way. Plus, this is the language that
        gave us shampoo, <br />
        jungle, jodhpurs and bungalow — what’s not to love?
